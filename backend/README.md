# Backend

This folder is reserved for the backend service.

Suggested next steps:
- Initialize a Node.js server (Express/Fastify).
- Define REST endpoints for notes, users, purchases.
- Connect a database (PostgreSQL/SQLite).
- Implement authentication and payment integration.

For now, this is a placeholder.
